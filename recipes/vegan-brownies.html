        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Try these soft, squidgy brownies, without the dairy or eggs. They're perfect for vegans and people following a dairy-free diet and taste utterly divine.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp ground flaxseed</li>
            <li>200g dark chocolate, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1/2tsp coffee granules</li>
            <li>80g vegan margarine, plus extra for greasing
            </li>
            <li>125g self-raising flour</li>
            <li>70g ground almonds</li>
            <li>50g cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1/4tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>250g golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2tsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 170C/150C fan/gas 3½. Grease and line a 20cm square tin with baking parchment. Combine the flaxseed with 6 tbsp water and set aside for at least 5 mins.</li>
            <li>Put the flour, almonds, cocoa, baking powder and ¼ tsp salt in a bowl and stir to remove any lumps. Using a hand whisk, mix the sugar into the melted chocolate mixture, and beat well until smooth and glossy, ensuring all the sugar is well dissolved. Stir in the flaxseed mixture, vanilla extract and remaining chocolate, then the flour mixture. Spoon into the prepared tin.</li>
            <li>Bake for 35-45 mins until a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean with moist crumbs. Allow to cool in the tin completely, then cut into squares. Store in an airtight container and eat within three days.</li>
        </ol>
